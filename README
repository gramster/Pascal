A Pascal compiler and p-code virtual machine. IIRC I extracted this from
the Estelle one in the PEW, as Estelle is a superset of Pascal.
(https://github.com/gramster/PEW). Only integers are supported; this harkens
from the days when floating point operations actually required a dedicated
coprocessor to be performant and not all computers had them.
